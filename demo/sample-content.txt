Introduction to Photosynthesis - Grade 6 Science

Photosynthesis is one of the most important biological processes on Earth. It is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll.

Key Concepts:
1. Chlorophyll - The green pigment in plants that captures light energy
2. Carbon Dioxide - Gas that plants absorb from the air
3. Water - Essential component absorbed through roots
4. Glucose - Sugar produced as food for the plant
5. Oxygen - Gas released as a byproduct

The Photosynthesis Equation:
6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2

Process Steps:
1. Light Absorption: Chlorophyll in leaves absorbs sunlight
2. Water Uptake: Roots absorb water from soil
3. Carbon Dioxide Entry: Stomata allow CO2 to enter leaves
4. Chemical Reaction: Light energy converts CO2 and H2O into glucose
5. Oxygen Release: O2 is released through stomata as waste

Importance of Photosynthesis:
- Produces oxygen for all living organisms
- Creates food for plants and indirectly for all life
- Removes carbon dioxide from atmosphere
- Forms the base of most food chains

Activities:
1. Observe leaf structure under microscope
2. Test for starch in leaves using iodine
3. Investigate factors affecting photosynthesis rate
4. Create a photosynthesis diagram

Assessment Questions:
1. What are the raw materials needed for photosynthesis?
2. Where does photosynthesis occur in plants?
3. Why is photosynthesis important for life on Earth?
4. What would happen if plants could not photosynthesize?
