## 1. Computer Science - Introduction to Python Programming

### PDF Content: Python Basics Textbook Excerpt

**Chapter 1: Variables and Data Types**

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. In this chapter, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of variables and data types.

**1.1 Variables**
Variables in Python are containers for storing data values. Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

```python
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"
print(x)
print(y)
```

**1.2 Data Types**
Python has several built-in data types:
- Text Type: str
- Numeric Types: int, float, complex
- Sequence Types: list, tuple, range
- Mapping Type: dict
- Set Types: set, frozenset
- Boolean Type: bool

**1.3 String Operations**
Strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. You can access elements of a string using square brackets.

```python
name = "Python Programming"
print(name[0])  # Output: P
print(name[7:18])  # Output: Programming
```

**Learning Objectives:**
- Students will be able to create and use variables in Python
- Students will understand different data types and their applications
- Students will demonstrate string manipulation techniques
- Students will apply variable concepts to solve basic programming problems

**Assessment Questions:**
1. What is the output of `print(type(5.0))`?
2. Create a variable that stores your name and print it
3. Explain the difference between a list and a tuple

## 2. Mathematics - Algebra Fundamentals

### Video Resource: Khan Academy Style Content

**Video Title: "Solving Linear Equations - Step by Step"**
**Duration: 8 minutes**
**URL: https://example.com/algebra-linear-equations**

**Video Transcript Excerpt:**

"Welcome to our lesson on solving linear equations. Today we'll learn how to solve equations like 2x + 5 = 13.

A linear equation is an equation where the highest power of the variable is 1. Our goal is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.

Let's solve 2x + 5 = 13:
Step 1: Subtract 5 from both sides
2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
2x = 8

Step 2: Divide both sides by 2
2x ÷ 2 = 8 ÷ 2
x = 4

Let's check our answer: 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 ✓

Practice Problems:
1. Solve: 3x - 7 = 14
2. Solve: 5x + 2 = 22
3. Solve: -2x + 10 = 4"

**Learning Objectives:**
- Students will understand the concept of linear equations
- Students will apply systematic steps to solve linear equations
- Students will verify solutions by substitution
- Students will solve real-world problems using linear equations

## 3. Biology - Cell Structure and Function

### Textbook Excerpt: High School Biology

**Chapter 3: The Cell - Basic Unit of Life**

**3.1 Introduction to Cells**
All living organisms are composed of one or more cells. The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of life. There are two main types of cells: prokaryotic and eukaryotic.

**3.2 Cell Theory**
The cell theory consists of three main principles:
1. All living things are composed of one or more cells
2. The cell is the basic unit of life
3. All cells arise from pre-existing cells

**3.3 Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic Cells**

| Feature | Prokaryotic | Eukaryotic |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Nucleus | No true nucleus | Membrane-bound nucleus |
| DNA | Freely floating | Contained in nucleus |
| Organelles | Few, no membrane-bound | Many membrane-bound organelles |
| Size | Generally smaller (1-10 μm) | Generally larger (10-100 μm) |
| Examples | Bacteria, Archaea | Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists |

**3.4 Cell Organelles and Their Functions**

**Nucleus:** Controls cell activities and contains DNA
**Mitochondria:** Powerhouse of the cell, produces ATP
**Ribosomes:** Protein synthesis
**Endoplasmic Reticulum:** Transport system within the cell
**Golgi Apparatus:** Modifies and packages proteins
**Lysosomes:** Digest waste materials

**Learning Objectives:**
- Students will distinguish between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
- Students will identify major cell organelles and their functions
- Students will explain the cell theory and its significance
- Students will analyze how cell structure relates to function

**Laboratory Activity:**
Observe prepared slides of plant and animal cells under a microscope. Identify and draw the following structures:
- Cell membrane
- Nucleus
- Cytoplasm
- Chloroplasts (plant cells only)
- Cell wall (plant cells only)
