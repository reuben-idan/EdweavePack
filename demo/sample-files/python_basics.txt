Introduction to Python Programming
Chapter 1: Getting Started with Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes code readability and simplicity. Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

1.1 What is Python?
Python is known for its clean syntax and powerful capabilities. It supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python's philosophy emphasizes that code should be readable and that there should be one obvious way to do things.

Key Features of Python:
- Easy to learn and use
- Interpreted language (no compilation needed)
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Extensive standard library
- Large community and ecosystem
- Free and open-source

1.2 Installing Python
Python can be downloaded from python.org. The installation includes:
- Python interpreter
- IDLE (Integrated Development Environment)
- Standard library modules
- Documentation

1.3 Your First Python Program
Let's start with the traditional "Hello, World!" program:

print("Hello, World!")

This simple program demonstrates:
- The print() function displays output
- Strings are enclosed in quotes
- No semicolons or complex syntax required

1.4 Variables and Data Types
Variables in Python are created when you assign a value to them:

name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 5.6
is_student = True

Python has several built-in data types:
- Strings (str): Text data
- Integers (int): Whole numbers
- Floats (float): Decimal numbers
- Booleans (bool): True or False values
- Lists: Ordered collections
- Dictionaries: Key-value pairs

1.5 Basic Operations
Python supports standard mathematical operations:

# Arithmetic operations
result = 10 + 5    # Addition: 15
result = 10 - 3    # Subtraction: 7
result = 4 * 6     # Multiplication: 24
result = 15 / 3    # Division: 5.0
result = 17 // 5   # Floor division: 3
result = 17 % 5    # Modulus: 2
result = 2 ** 3    # Exponentiation: 8

Learning Objectives:
By the end of this chapter, students should be able to:
1. Explain what Python is and its key characteristics
2. Install Python on their computer
3. Write and run simple Python programs
4. Create variables and understand basic data types
5. Perform arithmetic and string operations
6. Use input() and print() functions effectively
7. Add comments to their code
