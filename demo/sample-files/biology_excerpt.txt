Chapter 3: Cell Structure and Function

3.1 Introduction to Cells
All living organisms are composed of one or more cells. The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of life. There are two main types of cells: prokaryotic and eukaryotic.

3.2 Cell Theory
The cell theory consists of three main principles:
1. All living things are composed of one or more cells
2. The cell is the basic unit of life
3. All cells arise from pre-existing cells

3.3 Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic Cells

Prokaryotic Cells:
- No true nucleus
- DNA freely floating in cytoplasm
- Few organelles, no membrane-bound organelles
- Generally smaller (1-10 μm)
- Examples: Bacteria, Archaea

Eukaryotic Cells:
- Membrane-bound nucleus
- DNA contained in nucleus
- Many membrane-bound organelles
- Generally larger (10-100 μm)
- Examples: Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists

3.4 Cell Organelles and Their Functions

Nucleus: Controls cell activities and contains DNA
Mitochondria: Powerhouse of the cell, produces ATP
Ribosomes: Protein synthesis
Endoplasmic Reticulum: Transport system within the cell
Golgi Apparatus: Modifies and packages proteins
Lysosomes: Digest waste materials

Learning Objectives:
- Students will distinguish between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
- Students will identify major cell organelles and their functions
- Students will explain the cell theory and its significance
- Students will analyze how cell structure relates to function
