Welcome to our lesson on solving linear equations. Today we'll learn how to solve equations like 2x + 5 = 13.

A linear equation is an equation where the highest power of the variable is 1. Our goal is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.

Let's solve 2x + 5 = 13:

Step 1: Subtract 5 from both sides
2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
2x = 8

Step 2: Divide both sides by 2
2x ÷ 2 = 8 ÷ 2
x = 4

Let's check our answer: 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 ✓

The key principle is maintaining balance - whatever you do to one side, you must do to the other side.

Practice Problems:
1. Solve: 3x - 7 = 14
2. Solve: 5x + 2 = 22
3. Solve: -2x + 10 = 4

Remember: Always check your solution by substituting back into the original equation.

Learning Objectives:
- Understand the concept of linear equations
